# Pollify

Pollify is a web app that allows you to create, share, and monitor the results of polls —> including custom and image-based polls.

I built Pollify because I wanted more flexibility than existing polling platforms offer. Most tools felt limiting, especially for visual or non-standard polls, so I created something that supports more customizable polling use cases.
